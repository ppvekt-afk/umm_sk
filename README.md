# Social Media Skills

**Give your AI agent the skills of a top-1% social media team. 106 of them, free.**

Install these and your agent stops giving generic social media advice and starts doing the
actual work: it learns your brand and voice, plans your content calendar, writes LinkedIn
posts that win the "see more" tap, scripts Reels that hold watch-through, briefs your
thumbnails and pins, grows each platform the way that platform actually works — and when
everything's ready, gets it posted, on your explicit go.

- **It sounds like you.** Every skill reads your brand profile and voice guide before writing
  a word — no interchangeable AI-slop, no engagement bait, no fabricated stats.
- **It knows this year's playbook, not 2023's.** Each skill encodes how top practitioners work
  right now — the algorithms, formats, and platform mechanics — fact-checked and kept current.
- **It covers the whole job.** Strategy, planning, writing, video, design, growth, community,
  analytics: 106 skills across 14 topics that know about each other and hand work to the right
  specialist, from brand foundation to published post.

## Quick start

**One command (recommended)** — the [skills CLI](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) installs
into whatever agent you use:

```bash
npx skills add social-media-skills/skills
```

Run it interactively and pick your agent(s) when prompted — that ensures skills land where your
agent actually reads them (e.g. `~/.claude/skills/` for Claude Code), not only in the generic
`.agents/skills/` directory. Alternatively, [SkillKit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/skillkit)
installs across 40+ agents:

```bash
npx skillkit install social-media-skills/skills
```

**Claude Code plugin** — install once, get updates automatically:

```
/plugin marketplace add social-media-skills/skills
/plugin install social-media-skills@social-media-skills
```

**Manual copy (Claude Code / Claude Desktop)**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/social-media-skills/skills.git social-media-skills
cp -r social-media-skills/skills/* ~/.claude/skills/
```

Downloaded the ZIP instead? Unzip it, then copy the same way. Prefer a lighter install? Copy
just the starter set and add more as you need them:

```bash
cd social-media-skills/skills
cp -r brand-profile voice-builder audience-research content-pillars content-calendar \
      hook-writer caption-writer short-form-video-script cross-platform-repurposing \
      engagement-routine platform-specs-and-validation scheduling-and-queue ~/.claude/skills/
```

**Keep it updated** — plugin installs update themselves; for a copied install, `git pull` and
re-copy, or add the repo as a git submodule. Prefer your own tweaks? Fork it — the license is
MIT and [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) documents the house pattern.

**Claude app (claude.ai on web or mobile — no terminal needed)**

Custom skills work on every Claude plan, uploaded one skill at a time. The easy path is a
**topic pack** — one download with ready-to-upload ZIPs for a complete job, plus step-by-step
instructions inside:

| Pack | What it covers |
|---|---|
| **Social Media Starter Kit** | Brand setup, voice, calendar, first posts, scheduling |
| **Content Calendar & Planning** | The living calendar, batch planning, campaigns, seasonal moments |
| **Post Writing Essentials** | Hooks, captions, text posts, threads, carousels |
| **LinkedIn Growth** | The growth system, posts, company pages, strategic commenting |
| **Instagram & Reels Growth** | Growth, Reels scripts, Stories, carousels, keyword SEO |
| **TikTok Growth** | Growth, scripts, photo mode, publishing config, trends |
| **YouTube Creator Kit** | Long-form, Shorts, metadata, thumbnails |
| **X / Twitter Growth** | Growth system, threads, posts, replies, trends |
| **Facebook Growth** | Page strategy, Groups, short-form video, community |
| **Pinterest Growth** | Growth, keyword SEO, fresh-pin design, traffic |
| **Threads Growth** | Conversation-first growth, posts, the reply flywheel |
| **Video Creation Studio** | Script → on-camera or AI video → clipped and published |
| **Visual & Design** | Brand template system + AI image tools, cards, thumbnails |
| **AI Voice & Music** | AI voiceover, narration, owned brand music and stings |
| **Engagement & Community** | Daily engagement routine, community, collabs, creators, DMs |
| **Analytics & Optimization** | Honest goals, reporting, audits, testing |
| **Agency & Client Management** | Running social for clients end to end |

Every pack bundles the connection guide each tool skill needs (e.g. the WoopSocial guide with
the scheduling skill), so each skill works self-contained once uploaded.

1. Download a pack from the **Releases** page (or grab individual skill ZIPs there).
2. In Claude, open **Customize → Skills → + Create skill** and upload each ZIP inside the pack
   (requires code execution enabled in Settings). Toggle them on.
3. Follow the README inside the pack — a few minutes of uploads, once.

On **Team/Enterprise** plans, one person can upload the skills and share them with the whole
organization — no per-seat setup. (Maintainers: `./scripts/build-packs.sh` rebuilds all packs
and per-skill ZIPs into `dist/`.)

**OpenClaw** — copy skill folders into your workspace `skills/` directory (or
`~/.openclaw/skills` for all agents). Skills follow the same `SKILL.md` standard OpenClaw uses.

**Hermes Agent** — drop skill folders into `~/.hermes/skills/` (or your project's `skills/`),
or find these skills in the Hermes marketplace (`hermes skills search social media`).

**Any other agent framework** — skills are plain Markdown following the
[Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) convention (`SKILL.md` + frontmatter `name` /
`description`), the same ecosystem used by Claude Code, Cursor, Codex CLI, OpenClaw, Hermes,
and 20+ other agents. Point your loader at `skills/` or copy individual skill folders into
your agent's skills directory.

## Your first 15 minutes

The skills read and write a small set of brand files, so **work in a dedicated folder per
brand** (`mkdir my-brand && cd my-brand` before starting your agent). Then say, in order:

1. **"Set up my brand profile."** The agent interviews you (or mines your site/existing
   posts) and writes `brand-profile.md` — the source of truth every other skill reads first.
   Add **"build my voice guide"** and it derives `voice.md` from your actual writing.
2. **"Build my content pillars and a two-week content calendar."** You'll get the 3–5 themes
   and a concrete plan mapped to your platforms.
3. **"Write this week's posts."** The format writers produce platform-native drafts in your
   voice — captions, a LinkedIn post, a Reels script, whatever the calendar calls for.
4. **"Schedule them."** The publishing skill validates every post against platform rules,
   shows you exactly what will go out where and when, and — the first time — walks you
   through connecting a scheduler. Nothing is ever posted without your explicit yes.

From there it compounds: ask for a launch plan, a competitor teardown, a month of content in
one sitting, or "why did this post flop?" — the skills route to each other automatically.
Running multiple brands? One folder per brand; the profile in each folder keeps them separate.

## How the skills chain

```
FOUNDATION            brand-profile → voice-builder → audience-research → social-strategy
     │                (every content skill reads these first)
     ▼
PLAN                  content-pillars → idea-generation-and-ideation → content-calendar
     │                → batch-content-plan → campaign-and-launch-planning
     ▼
CREATE                hook-writer + the format writers (caption-writer, linkedin-post-writer,
     │                reels-script, tiktok-script, thread-writer, carousel-writer, …)
     ▼                × the content angles (educational, storytelling, contrarian, BTS, …)
MEDIA                 image-prompt/ai-video routers → nano-banana, ideogram, flux,
     │                veo-3, kling, luma, heygen, synthesia, ai-voiceover, suno
     │                → edited in capcut / descript / opus-clip / canva
     ▼
PUBLISH               scheduling-and-queue  (validate → confirm → schedule/post)
     ▼
GROW & ENGAGE         engagement-routine, reply-and-comment-writer, community-management,
     │                the platform growth playbooks (linkedin-growth, tiktok-growth, …)
     ▼
MEASURE & RECYCLE     analytics-and-reporting → content-audit → experimentation-and-ab-testing
                      → content-recycling / cross-platform-repurposing  (feeds PLAN again)
```

An agent with the full set routes between them automatically — ask for "a launch plan for my
app" and it will walk foundation → plan → create → publish, offering to set up scheduling
when it's time to post.

## Repo layout

```
skills/                  106 skills; each: SKILL.md + references/ + evals/
tools/
  REGISTRY.md            index of agent-usable tool integrations
  integrations/          per-tool connection guides (publishing, image, video, audio, editing)
```

## Design principles

1. **One skill = one job-to-be-done**, with explicit boundaries and routing to its neighbors.
2. **Foundation first** — content skills read `brand-profile` and `voice-builder` before writing.
3. **The agent drafts, the human judges, then it publishes** — never the other way around.
4. **No fabrication** — no invented stats, no fake engagement tactics, no "guaranteed virality."
5. **Confirmation before side effects** — nothing is posted, scheduled, or deleted without an
   explicit yes.
6. **Volatile facts are marked** — platform specs and tool pricing carry a *verify-quarterly*
   flag rather than pretending to be timeless.

## Contributing

The fastest useful PR: add a tool integration (`tools/integrations/<name>.md` + a row in
[`tools/REGISTRY.md`](tools/REGISTRY.md)) or a skill following the house pattern — study
[skills/x-growth/](skills/x-growth/SKILL.md) for the structure (SKILL.md + 4 references +
evals). Every skill-name mention must resolve to a real skill directory.
